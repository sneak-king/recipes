# Steam-Fried Eggs

I've worked on this breakfast dish for a while. I love eggs in the morning, but overfried eggs are my worst enemy. You know, the darker, rubbery parts that were touching the pan. I tried poaching eggs, but they always came apart in the water. I've finally arived at a hybrid approach, frying the eggs a bit then steaming them in a bit of water.


## Ingredients

2 eggs
2 slices of bread, generally whole grain
1/4 tablespoon butter (optional if your pan is non-stick enough)
1 clove of garlic (optional)
Pinch crushed red pepper

## Directions

As finely as you'd like, mince **garlic**. Melt **butter** in very-non-stick 8-inch pan over medium heat. Throw garlic into melted butter and fry for ~30 seconds, utill fragrant.

Carefully break both **eggs** into pan. Place **bread** in toaster. Use spatula to move eggs around a bit so all the garlic sticks to them. Just after the thinest parts of the egg start to solidify and turn white (maybe 60 seconds), carefully fold the egg in half, almost like an omelette. If possible, turn egg over entirely but be careful not to break yoke.

Now add about 2 tablespoons water to the pan and cover immediately. As the water boils the steam will cook the egg. If all the water evaporates, then add a bit more. After about 1-2 minutes, once whites are all cooked and yoke is somewhat solid, they're done. Feel free to give thim another minute if you like a firmer yoke.

Remove toast from toaster, butter it a bit if you like, then transfer eggs from pan to toast. Sprinkle with CRPepper and enjoy with
I often add a bit of dried basil, dill, or shallots with the garlic for more flavors. After the egg is on the toast, try  knife and fork.

## Variations

I often add a bit of dried basil, dill, or shallots with the garlic for more flavors. After the egg is on the toast, try paprika.
