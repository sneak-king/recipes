# Nicollet Curry

A hearty, flavorful curry. Great over rice or with bread. Reheats perfectly.

## Ingredients

#### Aromatics

* 1 clove garlic
* Thumb-length minced ginger
* 1 shallot (optional)

#### Spices

* 1 tablespoon garam masala
* 1 tablespoon curry powder
* 3/2 teaspoon cayan pepper powder
* teaspoon tumeric (optional)
* pinch of ground cloves (optional)

#### Volume, Filler, Meat and Potatoes

* can of coconut milk
* can of chickpeas
* can of diced tomatoes
* 1 lb chicken
* 1 yellow onion
* Can of peas (optional)

#### Other

* tablespoon-ish of oil
* 1 habanero pepper (optional >;)
* rice or bread

## Directions
Mix spices together, mince up all the aromatics.

Heat oil in pan over med-high heat. Add **aromatics** and fry for 3 minutes until it smells good. Add **onions**, fry until they begin to become translucent, then add **chicken**. Fry until chicken is 1/2 cooked. Add **spices** and stir around and coat everything, then add **diced tomatoes**.

Adjust heat to a light simmer, and add **coconut milk**, **chickpeas**, and **peas**. Simmer until chicken is cooked about, 10 minutes.

## Variations
Add **potatoes** instead of chickpeas. Dice them into 0.5cm cubes. They take a lot longer to cook, so add them right after the diced tomatoes, and simmer for 20 minutes.
