# Beef and Broccoli Stir-Fry

A quick Stirfry that isn't too damanding on the ingredients. Taken from [America's Test Kitchen Cooking for Two Cookbook](amazon.com/Complete-Cooking-Two-Cookbook/dp/1936493837).

## Ingredients

#### Sauce

* 1/4 cup Asian sweet chili sauce
* 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
* 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil


#### Volume

* 12 oz steak
* 1 red pepper, sliced into matchsticks
* 6 oz broccoli florets, cut into 1-inch pieces
* 2 green onions, minced and separated into greens and whites

## Directions

Mix together 1/4 cup water, **1 tablespoon sesame oil**, and the other **sauce** Ingredients. Add a tablespoon or two of sauce, **green onion whites** and remaining **1 tablespoon sesame oil** to thin cut steak, and marinade in fridge for 10-30min.

In a 12-inch skillet over high heat, cook **broccoli** and **pepper** in 1/4 cup of water covered for about 3 mintues. Then uncover and cook until water is evaporated, about 3 more minutes, before transfering to bowl.

Pour beef, marinade and all, into hot skillet and cook until lightly browned on all sides, about 6 minutes. Stir in cooked vegitables and **green onion greens** and heat until sause is thickened, maybe a minute. Serve over rice.

## Variations
Yeah, I know. What's **Oyster Sauce**? It's a thick sweet sause used in chinese cooking, also called plumb sauce. Hoisin substitutes well, with perhaps a splash of fish sause too.

Intead of broccoli try [any suggestions?].
